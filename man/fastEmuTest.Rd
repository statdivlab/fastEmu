\arguments{
\item{constraint_cats}{a vector of category indices for categories that should be involved in the constraint
and retained in any smaller joint model}

\item{Y}{an n x J matrix or dataframe of nonnegative observations, or a phyloseq object containing an otu table and sample data.}

\item{X}{an n x p matrix or dataframe of covariates (optional)}

\item{formula}{a one-sided formula specifying the form of the mean model to be fit}

\item{data}{an n x p data frame containing variables given in \code{formula}}

\item{cluster}{a numeric vector giving cluster membership for each row of Y to
be used in computing GEE test statistics. Default is NULL, in which case rows of
Y are treated as independent.}

\item{penalize}{logical: should Firth penalty be used in fitting model? Default is TRUE.}

\item{B}{starting value of coefficient matrix (p x J). If not provided,
B will be initiated as a zero matrix.}

\item{fitted_model}{a fitted model produced by a separate call to emuFit; to
be provided if score tests are to be run without refitting the full unrestricted model.
Default is NULL.}

\item{refit}{logical: if B or fitted_model is provided, should full model be fit (TRUE) or
should fitting step be skipped (FALSE), e.g., if score tests are to be run on an already
fitted model. Default is TRUE.}

\item{test_kj}{a data frame whose rows give coordinates (in category j and
covariate k) of elements of B to construct hypothesis tests for. If \code{test_kj}
is not provided, all elements of B save the intercept row will be tested.}

\item{alpha}{nominal type 1 error level to be used to construct confidence intervals. Default is 0.05
(corresponding to 95\% confidence intervals)}

\item{return_wald_p}{logical: return p-values from Wald tests? Default is FALSE.}

\item{compute_cis}{logical: compute and return Wald CIs? Default is TRUE.}

\item{run_score_tests}{logical: perform robust score testing? Default is TRUE.}

\item{use_fullmodel_info}{logical: TODO? Default is FALSE.}

\item{use_fullmodel_cov}{logical: use information matrix and empirical score covariance
computed for full model fit? Defaults to FALSE, in which case these quantities are
recomputed for each null model fit for score testing.}

\item{use_both_cov}{logical: should score tests be run using information and
empirical score covariance evaluated both under the null and full models?
Used in simulations}

\item{verbose}{provide updates as model is being fitted? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{tolerance}{tolerance for stopping criterion in full model fitting; once
no element of B is updated by more than this value in a single step, we exit
optimization. Defaults to 1e-3.}

\item{B_null_tol}{numeric: convergence tolerance for null model fits for score testing (if max of absolute difference in
B across outer iterations is below this threshold, we declare convergence).
Default is 0.01.}

\item{rho_init}{numeric: value at which to initiate rho parameter in augmented Lagrangian
algorithm. Default is 1.}

\item{inner_tol}{numeric: convergence tolerance for augmented Lagrangian subproblems
within null model fitting. Default is 1.}

\item{ntries}{numeric: how many times should optimization be tried in null
models where at least one optimization attempt fails? Default is 4.}

\item{tau}{numeric: value to scale rho by in each iteration of augmented Lagrangian
algorithm that does not move estimate toward zero sufficiently. Default is 2.}

\item{kappa}{numeric: value between 0 and 1 that determines the cutoff on the ratio
of current distance from feasibility over distance in last iteration triggering
scaling of rho. If this ratio is above kappa, rho is scaled by tau to encourage
estimate to move toward feasibility.}

\item{constraint_tol}{numeric: constraint tolerance for fits under null hypotheses
(tested element of B must be equal to constraint function to within this tolerance for
a fit to be accepted as a solution to constrained optimization problem). Default is 1e-5.}

\item{c1}{numeric: parameter for Armijo line search. Default is 1e-4.}

\item{maxit}{maximum number of outer iterations of augmented lagrangian algorithm to perform before
exiting optimization. Default is 1000.}

\item{inner_maxit}{maximum number of coordinate descent passes through columns of B to make within each
outer iteration of augmented lagrangian algorithm before exiting inner loop}

\item{max_step}{maximum stepsize; update directions computed during optimization
will be rescaled if a step in any parameter exceeds this value. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{trackB}{logical: should values of B be recorded across optimization
iterations and be returned? Primarily used for debugging. Default is FALSE.}

\item{return_nullB}{logical: should values of B under null hypothesis be returned.
Primarily used for debugging. Default is FALSE.}

\item{return_both_score_pvals}{logical: should score p-values be returned using both
information matrix computed from full model fit and from null model fits? Default is
FALSE. This parameter is used for simulations - in any applied analysis, type of
p-value to be used should be chosen before conducting tests.}

\item{model}{deprecated argument, default is "drop" to run the reduced model that drops
all categories not in the constraint or being tested for each score test, "full" to run tests
with the full joint model (equivalent to radEmu), or "agg" to run a different version of the reduced
model in which all categories not in the constraint or being tested are aggregated together}
}
\value{
A list containing elements 'coef', 'B', 'penalized', 'Y_augmented',
'I', and 'Dy'.  Parameter estimates by
covariate and outcome category (e.g., taxon for microbiome data), as well as
optionally confidence intervals and p-values, are contained in 'coef'. 'B'
contains parameter estimates in matrix format (rows indexing covariates and
columns indexing outcome category / taxon). 'penalized' is equal to TRUE
if Firth penalty is used in estimation (default) and FALSE otherwise. 'I' and
'Dy' contain an information matrix and empirical score covariance matrix
computed under the full model.
